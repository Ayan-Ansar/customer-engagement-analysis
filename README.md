## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data insights project that utilizes SQL, MySQL Workbench for data extraction, and Tableau for data visualization. The project focuses on extracting data from a database, exporting it as CSV files using MySQL Workbench, and creating interactive dashboards in Tableau to generate valuable insights.

## Project Description

In this project, we aimed to harness the power of data for making informed decisions. The project's main components are as follows:

1. **Data Extraction using MySQL Workbench:** We employed MySQL Workbench, a robust database management tool, to extract data from a database. Customized SQL queries were used to retrieve specific data, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

2. **Data Export to CSV Files:** Once data was extracted, MySQL Workbench was used to export the data into CSV files. The tool provides a user-friendly interface for customizing the export settings to save the data in CSV format, which is highly compatible and portable, making it suitable for further analysis and processing.

3. **Data Visualization with Tableau:** Tableau, a renowned data visualization tool, was used to create interactive and informative dashboards. Various charts and graphs were developed to transform raw data into meaningful visual representations.

4. **Dashboard Design:** An intuitive and user-friendly dashboard was designed to present key insights from the data. Interactive features allowed users to explore the data and uncover trends and patterns effortlessly.

5. **Insights Generation:** The visualizations generated valuable insights, including revenue trends, customer behavior analysis, and geographical patterns. These insights empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Usage

1. **Data Extraction:** Review the SQL queries in the `SQL Queries` directory and modify them as needed to extract data from your own database using MySQL Workbench or any other SQL client.

2. **Data Export:** After executing the SQL queries and obtaining the resulting tables in MySQL Workbench, you can export these tables as CSV files from within the application. Make sure to customize the export settings to save the data in CSV format.

3. **Tableau Dashboard:** Import the CSV files into Tableau to create your dashboard. The `tableau_dashboard.twbx` file contains the pre-built dashboard, which you can customize based on your requirements.

## Prerequisites

- SQL Database with the necessary data
- MySQL Workbench or a similar SQL client for data extraction
- Tableau Desktop for modifying the dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data insights project that utilizes SQL, MySQL Workbench for data extraction, and Tableau for data visualization. The project focuses on extracting data from a database, exporting it as CSV files using MySQL Workbench, and creating interactive dashboards in Tableau to generate valuable insights.

## Project Description

In this project, we aimed to harness the power of data for making informed decisions. The project's main components are as follows:

1. **Data Extraction using MySQL Workbench:** We employed MySQL Workbench, a robust database management tool, to extract data from a database. Customized SQL queries were used to retrieve specific data, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

2. **Data Export to CSV Files:** Once data was extracted, MySQL Workbench was used to export the data into CSV files. The tool provides a user-friendly interface for customizing the export settings to save the data in CSV format, which is highly compatible and portable, making it suitable for further analysis and processing.

3. **Data Visualization with Tableau:** Tableau, a renowned data visualization tool, was used to create interactive and informative dashboards. Various charts and graphs were developed to transform raw data into meaningful visual representations.

4. **Dashboard Design:** An intuitive and user-friendly dashboard was designed to present key insights from the data. Interactive features allowed users to explore the data and uncover trends and patterns effortlessly.

5. **Insights Generation:** The visualizations generated valuable insights, including revenue trends, customer behavior analysis, and geographical patterns. These insights empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
